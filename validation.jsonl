Therapy can be incredibly beneficial when grappling with depression and feelings of worthlessness. When I work with individuals experiencing such concerns, I often help build coping mechanisms to alleviate depressive symptoms and strengthen self-esteem. This is frequently done through Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) practices. CBT is effective in enhancing awareness of how your thought patterns influence your beliefs, and subsequently, how those beliefs impact your actions and their outcomes. While this process isn't easy, it teaches that while we may not always control external events, we can certainly control our interpretations, feelings, and behaviors. CBT is a valuable tool for addressing depression, anxiety, toxic relationships, stress, self-esteem issues, codependency, and more."}]}]}

Instead of overindulging in \"comfort foods\" high in sugar and fat, focus on balanced meals with plenty of vegetables, fruits, and protein. When you feel the urge to snack, pause and ask yourself if you're truly hungry or just bored.\n\n2.  **Alcohol Consumption:** Alcohol is a depressant, and consuming it when you're already feeling down can worsen symptoms of sadness and anxiety. It's best to avoid alcohol, especially when engaging in outdoor winter activities. If you find yourself reaching for another drink, consider having a glass of water instead.\n\n3.  **Sunlight Exposure:** Maximize your exposure to natural sunlight or bright light, particularly in the morning. Spending time outdoors or near well-lit windows can make a significant difference.\n\n4.  **Stay Active:** Even if you can't get to your usual gym or exercise class, find ways to be active at home. There are many online resources, like YouTube, offering yoga, dance, or bodyweight exercise routines you can follow.\n\n5.  **Seek Support:** Talking about how you're feeling with someone you trust can be very helpful. If your feelings of depression and anxiety intensify, don't hesitate to reach out to a counselor. If you ever experience thoughts of suicide, please contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline immediately at 1-800-273-8255."}]}]}

I recall you mentioning feeling overwhelmed after a stressful work presentation last month, and the lingering effects of that stress might be contributing to these feelings. It's a good idea to track what might be leading to your anxiety. If the shaking is persistent, consulting your primary care physician is recommended, as it could be related to hormonal or chemical imbalances. It's common for anxiety, especially panic attacks, to create a cycle of worrying about having more panic attacks. Remember, panic attacks are your body's overactive protective response, a sort of \"fight or flight\" reaction to a perceived threat that isn't actually present. Here's an image that might help illustrate this: http://psychology.tools/fight-or-flight-response.html\n\nThere are several techniques that can help manage these feelings. Practicing breathing exercises, mindfulness, meditation, or yoga can be very effective. If you try breathing techniques, aim for a pattern like breathing in for a count of five, holding for five, and exhaling for five, repeating this several times. It's generally easier to learn and implement these when you're not in the midst of a panic attack. Panic attacks typically resolve within 5 to 10 minutes, and focusing on slowing your breathing or becoming aware of your surroundings can be most helpful as you begin to feel anxious. You can find additional techniques here: http://psychcentral.com/lib/9-ways-to-reduce-anxiety-right-here-right-now/\n\nAs you identify triggers, consider exploring what makes those situations so concerning for you and reflect on when you might have felt this way before."}]}]}

Once any physical factors are cleared, we can explore more subtle causes, like the mental pressure of \"hoping you can, but what if you can't?\" This mindset is a common performance inhibitor. Openly communicating with your wife about finding ways to enjoy intimacy without the immediate pressure of intercourse could also be very beneficial.

Experiencing intense nightmares, especially those involving being killed, can be incredibly distressing and is understandably impacting your sleep and daily life. It's very common for people to struggle with sleep problems, including frightening dreams. Given the trauma you've experienced recently, such as the unexpected passing of your dog, it's not uncommon for these difficult emotions to surface during sleep. Here are a few things to consider or try:\n\n1.  **Medication Review:** Have you started or changed any medications recently? Some medications can affect sleep patterns and even cause vivid or frightening dreams. If you're on new medication, it's worth discussing the nightmares with your provider to see if it might be the cause.\n\n2.  **Stressors:** Stress is a significant factor that can worsen sleep difficulties and influence dream content. Reflect on any new or renewed stressors in your life – work, school, relationships, or health concerns can all be sources. If stress is a factor, speaking with your provider or a counselor could be very beneficial.\n\n3.  **Pre-Sleep Anxiety:** It's possible that the anticipation of sleep itself has become a source of anxiety, especially after experiencing traumatic dreams. This fear can begin before you even go to bed. Engaging in relaxation techniques before sleep can help. Consider trying guided meditations for sleep (many are available on YouTube) or simple deep breathing exercises.\n\n4.  **Nightmare Management Techniques:** There are self-help strategies you can explore for managing nightmares. Searching online for \"Nightmare Rescripting\" or \"Nightmare Exposure\" may provide useful instructions and ideas for working through these dreams.\n\nI hope these suggestions offer some relief.

They feel pressure to be pure, and they also feel pressure to be the vixen and please men sexually. But you can't be both, so you can't ever win if you buy into all that horse manure (excuse my language).\n\nThis current hook-up culture puts added pressure on girls to expect nothing more than random sexual encounters that leave you feeling empty and used; perhaps desirable in that moment but mostly worthless. The stupid part is that research tells us that young men are also impacted negatively by this cultural norm that values sex and not relationship; they feel guilt, and loneliness. \n\nI urge you to talk to other girls and women about your feelings. I'm sure they will echo my words here, much like your sister has shared her own dating experiences with you. Your value and power cannot ever be found in whether a man wants you, whether you turn his eye, or how he treats you. Your sexuality is a beautiful part of who you are, and it is to be celebrated. I love that you want to celebrate it with someone who cares. Who you are is so very much more than your sexuality. You sound like you have a lot of things going for you. Try to see all of those things when you think of yourself.\n\nThere are many more virgins out there, and many are afraid, like you, that they don't fit in. We are all different, and you don't have to be anything but who you want to be; who you are. You don't have to have any kind of sex until you're ready, and that makes you brave and smart, not weird. You're tall and beautiful, and guys may be intimidated by that. It may take time for you to meet the right guy, but he's out there. The question is: How do you want to spend your time until he crosses your path? \n\nI hope you talk to someone soon and find out that your feelings are normal. I wish you the best."}]}]}

You're caught between wanting to preserve a valued friendship and struggling with lingering romantic feelings, especially when his actions, like the hugging and continued touching, can feel misleading. It's a common challenge when trying to get over someone you're still in contact with, especially since you've noted his affectionate nature and past instances of physical intimacy.\n\nTo navigate this, consider these approaches: \n\n1.  **Boundaries are Key:** Since you're trying to maintain the friendship and he's a hugger, it's crucial to set clearer boundaries around physical touch. While his hugs might feel friendly and sweet, they are currently fueling your fantasies and keeping the hope alive. Clearly communicating that you need to create some distance, at least physically, can help. This might involve gently stepping back when he goes for a hug or stating directly, \"I need to be really careful about how much physical contact we have right now.\" \n2.  **Focus on the \"Why\":** Remind yourself of the reasons why you want to get over him and maintain the friendship. Is it because you value his companionship? His advice? Understanding your motivations can strengthen your resolve. Also, reflect on why a romantic relationship isn't feasible for him, as you mentioned he \"clearly not interested\" and prefers a different \"type.\" \n3.  **Create Distance (Mentally and Physically):** While you're no longer in the same office, continuing to talk about work and maintaining constant contact can keep the romantic spark alive. If possible, try to limit non-essential conversations. When you do talk, try to steer conversations away from deeply personal topics that might reignite those past intimate moments.\n4.  **Seek New Connections:** Sometimes, the best way to get someone out of your system is to find someone new to focus your attention on. This doesn't mean you need to jump into another relationship immediately, but perhaps expanding your social circle or engaging in new hobbies could provide a healthy distraction and shift your focus.\n\nIt's very difficult to expect your feelings to change if the situation remains exactly as it is. Being proactive, whether through clear boundary setting or a more significant reduction in contact, will be essential. Good luck with this challenging situation!"}]}]}

It’s understandable that you’re experiencing separation anxiety. Given that you've previously felt overlooked when others don't respond to your messages quickly, this current situation with your boyfriend is likely amplifying those feelings.  Consider initiating a conversation with your boyfriend about establishing predictable times for communication while he's away. Knowing when you might be able to connect can provide some reassurance. It's also important to explore whether he recognizes the impact his absence and reduced communication are having on you. How do you feel when you are together and he is home? Perhaps you could track your anxiety levels on a scale of 1 to 10 during his trips, noting if certain activities or parts of the trip are more or less anxiety-provoking. For example, do you find your anxiety lessens when you're engaged in work or spending time with friends? When he's not traveling, do you maintain independent social activities? Understanding what specifically triggers your anxiety when he's away – is it a general longing for his return, or a fear of specific events? Have you experienced similar feelings in the past, and if so, what was happening then? Identifying things that make you feel safe and comfortable could also be helpful. If these feelings persist, consulting with a mental health professional, perhaps one specializing in couples therapy, could offer valuable support for both of you to navigate your relationship goals and contributions."}]}]}

This pattern, where someone feels trapped in isolation and disconnected from their inner self, is something I've seen addressed effectively through approaches like Contextual Conceptual Therapy (CCT). It often points to a profound internal pain that's led to coping mechanisms which inadvertently cut them off from their own sense of self, beauty, and ability to receive love. When someone is in such a state, their suicidal thoughts are often a cry from their soul, indicating they can't continue living as they are.

The recurring accusations of infidelity and the perception of disrespect, especially when your intentions differ, can significantly strain a relationship. Given that your wife's insecurity might be rooted in past relationship trauma, it's understandable that she may be projecting those fears onto your current situation. Accusations of cheating can often be a cry for closeness or a manifestation of deeper anxieties about abandonment. When she calls you disrespectful for using a term like \"sweetheart\" at work, it might stem from her own past experiences or a fear that you are emotionally distancing yourself. It's crucial to address the underlying feelings rather than getting caught in a cycle of blame. Defining what \"infidelity\" means to each of you, reflecting on the context and intention behind your words, and exploring how you both show value and importance to each other are vital steps. If her actions stem from personal insecurities, encouraging her to seek professional support could be beneficial. The pattern of never admitting fault is also a significant barrier, as it prevents open communication and vulnerability. Focusing on your own emotional needs and how you express them, while creating a safe space for her to express hers, could lead to a more secure and understanding connection.

Given your concern that your grandson might be blaming himself for his parents' separation, it's crucial to address this underlying feeling, regardless of whether contact with his mother is facilitated. You mentioned he's acting out and wants to reconnect; this desire often stems from a deep-seated need for connection and reassurance. It's important to explore what he hopes to gain from this interaction. Is it simply to see her and know she's okay? Does he want an apology? Does he hope for a sense of being loved or wanted? Understanding his motivation will help you gauge the potential for a positive outcome. Before considering a direct meeting, it might be wise to assess the mother's current stability and your ability to communicate with her. There are also alternatives to direct contact, such as writing letters, emails, or texts, which might be a less overwhelming first step.

Managing these symptoms often begins with establishing a solid self-care routine. Start with the fundamentals: balanced meals, 6-8 hours of sleep, and at least 30 minutes of daily exercise. These habits can help regulate the chemical imbalances affecting your mood, and exercise offers a great way to de-stress and get a break from anxious thoughts. Once you have a basic self-care routine in place, exploring the root causes of these feelings through therapy is a great next step. If initiating self-care is a challenge, discuss with your therapist what motivates you to act. Additionally, consider speaking with your physician or a psychiatrist about potential medication options if starting basic self-care feels too difficult right now. ¿Cómo puedo controlar mi ansiedad? Uno de los primeros pasos para manejar la ansiedad y la depresión es establecer una buena rutina de cuidado personal. Comienza con las cosas más básicas: Comer comidas balanceadas, dormir de 6-8 horas en la noche, y ejercitarte por lo menos 30 minutos al día. Esto te ayudara a regular el desbalance químico que afecta tu estado de ánimo, además de que te da tiempo para desahogarte y distraerte. Ya que la rutina de cuidado eta establecida, es un buen momento para comenzar a explorar la fuente de tus sentimientos negativos, y explóralos a través de terapia. Si se dificulta comenzar a crear una rutina puedes consultar con tu terapista para identificar motivaciones que te impulsen a comenzar. También puedes contactar a tu medico primario o psiquiatra para discutir medicamentos que te pueden ayudar a manejar estos síntomas e iniciar cuidado básico."}]}]}

Fortunately, these are issues that counseling can effectively address. Addressing these concerns earlier is beneficial, as our early relationships often shape our adult connections. Therapy can be helpful even for young children, as mentioned on staceybshapiro.com, for navigating these types of challenges."}]}]}

It's important then to gently remind yourself *why* the relationship needed to end and how you are prioritizing your own well-being by doing so. \n\nIt's natural to feel responsible, especially when someone is going through a difficult divorce. However, there's rarely a 'perfect' time to end things, and sometimes the stress of *not* making a decision outweighs the stress of living with the consequences. It might be helpful to honestly compare what this relationship is giving you versus what you truly want and need from a partnership. Acknowledging fear, doubt, or even guilt is perfectly fine, but these feelings don't have to prevent you from making the healthiest choice for yourself.\n\nYou might be at a crossroads, and making a decision, even with the uncertainty, could ultimately bring more peace than staying in a situation that continues to hurt you. Be well.\n\n-Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC"}]}]}

It could be really helpful to see a counselor or therapist about your increasing depression and panic symptoms. Finding out the cause of depression and anxiety isn't always straightforward, as both issues tend to become ingrained patterns rather than solely tied to a specific trigger. For instance, if one feels down about a particular circumstance, they might start seeing life through that lens, and it can build rapidly. The same applies to anxiety. While this is a simplified example, a therapist can help identify how these patterns are maintained. I'd also be curious if you can start to notice the initial physical sensations of panic. If you can, try to maintain awareness of those sensations during an attack. Even better, try talking yourself through them, acknowledging what you're experiencing – \"Okay, my breathing is rapid, my heart is racing, my palms are sweaty, and my chest feels tight...\" – and reminding yourself that this is your body's stress response. While it might be overreacting, you are safe, and these sensations will pass. I highly recommend the SAM for Anxiety Management app; addressing the anxiety might also help alleviate some of the depression."}]}]}

However, these specific difficulties can be indicative of a learning disability called Dysgraphia, and given your nephew's experience, it's wise to explore this further. The most effective next step is to have educational testing done. You can initiate this by requesting an IEP (Individualized Educational Plan) meeting through your school system, as they are obligated to honor such requests. During the meeting, you can ask the school to conduct educational testing at no cost to you. Be aware that depending on your location and school system, obtaining this testing can sometimes be challenging. If you encounter difficulties, seeking evaluation from a psychologist or an agency that performs this type of testing is an option; some accept insurance, while others do not. You might also consider hiring an educational advocate to assist you. Additionally, consulting with a developmental ophthalmologist and/or a developmental pediatrician could provide valuable insights and resources. Trust your intuition as a parent; if you feel your child is struggling and may have a learning disability, pursuing an evaluation is always beneficial. The best outcome is that she's on track, but if she does have a learning disability, early identification allows for timely support and services that can make a significant difference in her long-term academic journey."}]}]}

If you feel comfortable enough, let them know you're feeling nervous and shaky before your sessions. Open communication is key to a healthy therapeutic relationship, and your therapist can help you understand and process the potential causes. This is your time for healing, and therapy should be a safe, supportive environment. If your therapist is aware of your feelings, they can help you move past these barriers.\n\nIf you're not comfortable discussing this with your therapist, it might be worth exploring why you feel that way. \n\nAs an additional suggestion, breathing exercises can be very beneficial. Remind yourself of what you are working to achieve. In a safe moment, close your eyes and breathe in slowly through your nose and out through your mouth with pursed lips. Try to inhale for approximately 5-10 seconds, then exhale slowly. Doing this when you feel safe can be incredibly helpful. Putting your hand on your stomach to feel your breath can also help. We often forget to breathe, especially when we're anxious.\n\nYou are supported here. Try practicing these breathing exercises several times a day. I hope this shaky and uneasy feeling eases. Wishing you the very best! \n\nLaura Cassity, LMSW, LMAC"}]}]}

The Yerkes-Dodson Law suggests that too much pressure or stress can indeed hinder performance, and this principle applies to sexual intimacy as well. An ideal level of arousal exists in the middle ground. A helpful step many men find is to have open and honest conversations with their partners. Agreeing, for a period, to focus on other forms of physical intimacy and pleasure, without the immediate expectation of intercourse, can reduce anxiety and renew your bonding. This can create space for connection and, over time, may help you return to the intimacy you both desire. Best of luck."}]}]}

You are not alone, and these feelings don't mean you're \"crazy.\" In fact, your experience of existential dread after your grandmother's passing likely amplifies these concerns. What's most important is to focus on the fear and anxiety you're experiencing now.  Scary or obsessive thoughts can feel out of control, but there are techniques to help manage them.  First, acknowledge that these are just thoughts. Your brain is a powerful thought machine, and while some thoughts drift by like clouds, others can trigger strong emotional responses. You can choose whether to follow these thought streams or work on gently redirecting your attention.  One helpful approach, as taught by Rick Hansen, is to consciously give more energy to positive thoughts and memories, making them more like \"Velcro\" in your mind, while allowing negative thoughts to be more like \"Teflon\" – not sticking around as long. This requires practice, so try pausing throughout the day to focus on positive feelings and memories, reinforcing positive thought patterns. When a scary thought arises, try to intentionally replace it with a happy experience for a few moments to lessen its negative charge. Additionally, when you find yourself consumed by these thoughts about death, take a moment to focus on your breath. Anxiety often leads to shallow chest breathing. By consciously taking deep, belly breaths, you can help slow down the anxiety cycle."}]}]}

Until that hole is patched – until you choose to fill your heart with love, either for another or, crucially, for yourself – you might find it challenging to 'keep driving on your road.' Instead of letting go of the intensity of that feeling, try to redirect it inwards. You've shared that you're capable of feeling so strongly for another; surely, you are worthy of that same deep regard? All the best~"}]}]}

Given that you've mentioned feeling a lack of financial independence and relying on them for housing, this plan might involve focusing on improving your job prospects to afford your own place, exploring domestic violence shelters, or having a direct conversation with your parents about your authority as a parent. A boundary that is not consistently upheld is no boundary at all. There's always a path forward, even when it feels like you have nowhere to go. The crucial part is to ask yourself why this is the case and what concrete steps you can take to change it. If you choose not to take action, you inadvertently enable the abusive dynamic to continue. Honestly assess your situation: Are you perhaps too dependent? Is changing easier than confronting the situation? Working on your self-esteem and finding empowering resources like support groups (online or in-person), faith-based organizations, friends, or inspirational materials can make a significant difference. Consider what steps you can take towards financial empowerment, whether it's pursuing further education or training in a new field. There are many possibilities for change. Focus on action."}]}]}

Given your past concerns about performance pressure, it's worth reflecting on any anxieties you might have about pleasing your wife or the overall dynamic in your intimate life. Sometimes, perceived insecurities can manifest in ways that affect physical intimacy.
